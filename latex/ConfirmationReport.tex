\section{\normalsize Introduction}
% The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics is a quantum field theory which
% describes the electromagnetic, strong and weak interactions, and classifies
% all known elementary particles. Work over the last century has developed this
% successful theory, and many aspects of it have been validated by particle
% physics experiments around the world, a substantial contribution of which has
% been made by the CERN experiment in Geneva. However, the SM does fall short in
% a number of aspects, one of which being its failure to describe the
% matter-antimatter asymmetry we see in the observable Universe.  Quantities of
% matter and antimatter should have been equally created by the Big Bang, but
% the observable Universe is almost entirely matter
% dominated~\cite{UniAsymmetry}. It is therefore postulated that baryogenesis,
% the process that produced baryon asymmetry, occurred in the early Universe.
% Three Sakharaov conditions are required for this to be possible: I) baryon
% number violation, II) C and $CP$ violation, III) deviation from thermal
% equilibrium~\cite{Sakharov}.
The Standard Model (SM) of particle physics, the quantum field theory describing
three of the four fundamental forces, allows for $CP$ violating processes, but the
level at which these processes occur would need to be several orders of
magnitude larger to account for the Universal matter-antimatter asymmetry. This
suggest that new physics, beyond the SM, is needed to fully describe this
asymmetry. The LHCb experiment at CERN has been designed to collect
unprecedented samples of decays of $B$ mesons and study many $CP$-violating
processes of the SM. This report will describe an ongoing measurement of a SM
parameter critical to this endeavour. \\

DESCRIPTION OF REPORT STRUCTURE.
\section{\normalsize Theoretical Background}
In the SM, the charged-current, weak interactions of quarks are described by the
SM Lagrangian term given in Eq.~\eqref{eq:CCLagrangian}.
\begin{equation}
  L_{CC}=-\frac{g}{\sqrt{2}}\overbar{q}_{Li}\gamma^{\mu}W_{\mu}^{+}(V_{CKM})_{ij}q_{Lj}
  + h.c.  
  \label{eq:CCLagrangian}
\end{equation}
\noindent Here, $W_{\mu}^{+}$ is the W-boson field, which couples to the
left-handed quark triplets, $\overbar{q}_{L}^{i}$ and $q_{L}^{j}$, where
$i,j=1,2,3$ are the generation numbers, and $V_{CKM}$ are elements of the
$3\times 3$ Cabbibo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM) matrix~\cite{CKMTheory}. These
elements are coupling constants quantifying the strength of iter- and
intra-generational mixing, and can be represented by complex numbers with arbitrary phases.

For a $3\times 3$ unitary matrix, $3^2=9$ real parameters must be specified. Our
ability to absorb one phase into each quark field, but inability to observe an
overall common phase, removes $5$ of these parameters. $4$ degrees of freedom
therefore remain: $3$ rotations and $1$ complex phase. It is the presence of
this single irreducible phase that can generate $CP$ violation in this sector.

Verifying the unitarity of the CKM matrix is an important test of the SM~\cite{CKMTheory}. This requirement can be summarised by $\sum_{k=1}^{3}V_{ik}V^*_{jk}=\delta_{ij}$. Of particular interest is the condition $V_{ud}V^{*}_{ub}+V_{cd}V^{*}_{cb}+V_{td}V^{*}_{tb}=0$, which forms the \emph{Unitarity Triangle} (UT) in the complex plane. The geometry of the UT allows all lengths and angles to be accessed experimentally, and thus it can be over-constrained, and used as a
probe of new physics in precision measurements of the quark-mixing parameters. 

The angles in this triangle, $\phi_1$, $\phi_2$ and $\phi_3$, can be accessed
experimentally via the study of $B$ meson decays. For many years, the least well
known angle was $\phi_3=\arg(-V_{ud}V^{*}_{ub}/V_{cd}V^{*}_{cb})$ (more commonly
referred to as $\gamma$), but recently its precision now rivals that of
$\phi_2$. $\phi_3$ can be thought of as the Standard Candle of the UT, as it can
be accessed via tree-level decays of $B$ mesons with very low theoretical
uncertainty, $\frac{\delta\gamma}{\gamma}\sim 10^{-7}$. The current World
average value using a combination of tree-level measurements is
$\phi_3=(74.0^{+5.0}_{-5.8})$\degree~\cite{LatestGamma}.

It is also possible to constrain $\phi_3$ indirectly, by excluding tree-level
measurements and performing global fits to the CKM triangle, as is shown in
Fig.~\ref{fig:CKMIndirectFit}. The current best indirect measurement is
$\phi_3=(65.64^{+0.97}_{-3.42})$\degree~\cite{website:CKMFitter}. The
difference between the values of the direct and indirect measurements is of
great interest in the current climate. Over the past few years, flavour
anomalies have appeared in measurements of $\mathcal{B} (B^{0}_{s}\rightarrow
\phi \mu \mu)$~\cite{B2phimumu}, $\mathcal{B} (B^{0}\rightarrow K^{*0} \mu
\mu)$~\cite{B2Kstmumu}, $R_{K}$~\cite{Rk}, $R_{K^{*0}}$~\cite{Rkst} and
$R_{D^{(*)-}}$~\cite{RDst}. Though none have reached a significance level to
justify a discovery, some combinations have ???. These anomalies, and the
contention in the measurements of $\phi_3$, could be explained by the presence
of new, heavy particles. It is therefore motivating to reduce the uncertainty
on $\phi_{3}$ using tree-level measurements to a size comparable to that
extracted from the indirect measurements.

using only constraints from `loop' quantities in the ($\rho$-bar, $\eta$-bar)
plane. The black line represents the fit obtained by CKM fitter.}}
\label{fig:CKMIndirectFit} \vspace{-10pt}
\end{figure}
A significant contribution to this effort comes from studying tree-level
processes of the type $B^{\pm}\rightarrow D^{0(*)}K^{\pm (*)}$~\cite{B2DKD2hh,
DalitzRun1, DalitzRun2, B2DKstD2hh, B2DstKD2hh}. The ADS~\cite{ADSRef} and
GLW~\cite{GLWRef} methods can be employed to access $\phi_3$, the relative weak
phase between the $b\rightarrow c\overbar{u}s$ and $b\rightarrow u\overbar{c}s$
transitions, as seen in the Feynman diagrams in Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DstarKstar}.
This report will study one variant, $B^{\pm}\rightarrow D^{*}K^{\pm}$ decays,
where the neutral D$^{*}$ meson represents $D^{*0}$ or $\overbar{D}^{*0}$ and
is reconstructed as either $D\pi^{0}$ or $D\gamma$.

\noindent The amplitude for producing a neutral ${D}^*$ meson in the decay $B^-\rightarrow \tilde{D^*}K^-$ can be expressed as:
  \begin{equation}
    \tilde{D}^*=D^{*0}+r_Be^{i(\delta_B-\phi_3)}\overbar{D}^{*0}
    \label{eq:DstTilde}
  \end{equation}
\noindent Writing this in terms of odd and even $CP$ eigenstates, where
$D^{*}_{+}=\frac{D^{*0}+\overbar{D}^{*0}}{\sqrt{2}}$ and
$D^{*}_{-}=\frac{D^{*0}-\overbar{D}^{*0}}{\sqrt{2}}$:
  \begin{equation}
    \tilde{D}^*=\frac{D^{*}_{+}+D^{*}_{-}}{\sqrt{2}}+r_Be^{i(\delta_B-\phi_3)}\frac{D^{*}_{+}-D^{*}_{-}}{\sqrt{2}}
    \label{eq:DstTildeCP}
  \end{equation}
\noindent Here, $r_B=\frac{|A(B^{-}\rightarrow
\overbar{D}^{*0}K^-)|}{|A(B^{-}\rightarrow {D}^{*0}K^-)|}$ and $\delta_{B}$ is
the relative strong phase between these $B^-$ decays.
 
The $CP$ eigenvalue of the $D^*$ state is given by the product
$\lambda_{D^*}=\lambda_D\times \lambda_{\pi^0\text{/}\gamma} \times(-1)^l$. In
the case of the strong $D^*$ decay via $\pi^0$ emission, $\lambda_{\pi^0}=-1$
and $l=1$ therefore $\lambda_{D^*}=\lambda_D$ and $D^*_{\pm}\rightarrow
D_{\pm}\pi^0$. Where as, for $\gamma$ emission, $\lambda_{\gamma}=+1$ and
$l=1$, to conserve parity, therefore $\lambda_{D^*}=-\lambda_D$ and
$D^*_{\pm}\rightarrow D_{\mp}\gamma$.  This introduces a phase shift of $\pi$
($e^{i\pi}=-1$) between the two neutral $D$ mesons produced in the decay
$B^-\rightarrow \tilde{D}^*K^-$ in the $D\gamma$ mode. This logic was first
shown in~\cite{ADSDstar}.
  \begin{equation}
		\tilde{D^*}\rightarrow \tilde{D}\pi^0 :
\tilde{D}=D^0+r_Be^{i(\delta_B-\phi_3)}\overbar{D}^0 \label{eq:DTildePi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		\tilde{D^*}\rightarrow \tilde{D}\gamma :
\tilde{D}=D^0+r_Be^{i(\delta_B+\pi-\phi_3)}\overbar{D}^0 \label{eq:DTildeGamma}

\label{fig:B2DstKDiagram} \vspace{-10pt}

Labelling the amplitude of the diagram displayed in Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DstarKstar} (a)
as $A_{B}=A(B^{-}\rightarrow
D^{*0}K^{-})=A(B^{+}\rightarrow \overbar{D}^{*0}K^{+})$, as shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DstKDiagram}, we can construct 4
equations for the decay amplitudes of $B^{-}$ mesons to final states
$f(\accentset{\brobor}{D}\phantom{})$:
\begin{equation}
    A_{Bf}^{\pi^{0}}=A(B^{-}\rightarrow
    [f(D)\pi^{0}]_{D^{*}}K^{-})=A_{B}A_{\pi^{0}}(A_{D}+\overbar{A}_{D}e^{-i\delta_D}r_{B}e^{(i(\delta_{B}-\phi_{3}))})
    \label{eq:A(Bf)pi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		A_{B\overbar{f}}^{\pi^{0}}=A(B^{-}\rightarrow
[f(\overbar{D})\pi^{0}]_{D^{*}}K^{-})=A_{B}A_{\pi^{0}}(\overbar{A}e^{-i\delta_D}_{D}+A_{D}r_{B}e^{(i(\delta_{B}-\phi_{3}))})
\label{eq:A(Bfbar)pi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{Bf}^{\gamma}=A(B^{-}\rightarrow
    [f(D)\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})=A_{B}A_{\gamma}(A_{D}+\overbar{A}_{D}e^{-i\delta_D}r_{B}e^{(i(\delta_{B}+\pi-\phi_{3}))})
    \label{eq:A(Bf)gamma}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		A_{B\overbar{f}}^{\gamma}=A(B^{-}\rightarrow
[f(\overbar{D})\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})=A_{B}A_{\gamma}(\overbar{A}_{D}e^{-i\delta_D}+A_{D}r_{B}e^{(i(\delta_{B}+\pi-\phi_{3}))})
\label{eq:A(Bfbar)gamma}
  \end{equation}
\noindent Compared to Fig.~\ref{fig:B2DstKDiagram}, in these equations we have
replaced $\accentset{\brobor}{A}\phantom{}_{D^{*}}$ with
$A_{\pi^{0}}\accentset{\brobor}{A}\phantom{}_{D}$ or
$A_{\gamma}\accentset{\brobor}{A}\phantom{}_{D}e^{{i\pi}}$. These amplitudes
are defined as: $\overbar{A}_{D}=A(D^{0}\rightarrow
f(\overbar{D}))=A(\overbar{D}^{0}\rightarrow f(D))$ and
$A_{D}=A(\overbar{D}^{0}\rightarrow f(\overbar{D}))=A(D^{0}\rightarrow f(D))$.
$\delta_D$ is the relative strong phase difference between the $D$ and
$\overbar{D}$ mesons decaying to the same final state. 4 analogous charge
conjugate equations can be written for the $B^{+}$ meson. 

When applying GLW method~\cite{GLWRef}, the $D$ meson is reconstructed in the
$CP$-even final states $D\rightarrow KK$ and $D\rightarrow \pi \pi$, therefore
$\delta_D=0$ and $A_{D}=\overbar{A}_{D}$ can also be factorised out. Time integrated decay rates are proportional to the squared magnitude of the amplitudes, therefore we can construct the following equations for $B^{\pm}$ mesons:
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{CP+}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[hh]_D\pi^{0}))\propto |A^{\pi^0}_{Bf_{CP}}|^2 \propto 1 + r_{B}^{2} +
2r_{B}\cos(\delta_{B}\mp \phi_{3}) \label{eq:DecayRateGLWpi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{CP-}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[hh]_D\gamma))\propto |A^{\gamma}_{Bf_{CP}}|^2 \propto 1 + r_{B}^{2} -
2r_{B}\cos(\delta_{B}\mp \phi_{3}) \label{eq:DecayRateGLWgamma}
  \end{equation}
\noindent The strong phase shift of $\pi$ from the
$D^{*}\rightarrow D\gamma$ decay converts the $CP+$ eigenstate from even to odd
in the context of $B^{\pm}\rightarrow D^{(*)0}K^{\pm}$ decays. This provides a
useful extra constraint in the extraction of $\phi_3$. 

In the ADS method~\cite{ADSRef}, the $D$ meson is reconstructed as
$D^{0}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-}$, $D^{0}\rightarrow K^{-}\pi^{+}$ and their
charge conjugates. The former is doubly Cabbibo suppressed with respect to the
latter, therefore we label these as the suppressed (SUP) and favoured (FAV)
modes. Defining $A_{D}=A(D^{0}\rightarrow
K^{-}\pi^{+})=A(\overbar{D}^{0}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-})$ and $\overbar{A}_{D}=
A(D^{0}\rightarrow K^{+}\pi^{-})=A(\overbar{D}^{0}\rightarrow
K^{-}\pi^{+})=A_{D}r_{D}e^{-i\delta_{D}}$, where $r_{D}$ is the amplitude ratio
of the SUP with respect to the FAV $D$ decay mode and $\delta_{D}$ is their
relative phase, we can construct the following decay rate equations for
$B^{\pm}$ mesons:
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{SUP}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}]_D\pi^{0}))\propto |A^{\pi^0}_{Bf_{SUP}}|^2 \propto r_{B}^{2}
+ r_{D}^{2} + 2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B} - \delta_{D} \mp \phi_{3})
\label{eq:DecayRateADSSUPpi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{SUP}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}]_D\gamma))\propto |A^{\gamma}_{Bf_{SUP}}|^2 \propto r_{B}^{2}
+ r_{D}^{2} - 2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B} - \delta_{D} \mp \phi_{3})
\label{eq:DecayRateADSSUPgamma}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{FAV}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}]_D\pi^{0}))\propto |A^{\pi^0}_{Bf_{FAV}}|^2 \propto 1 +
r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2} + 2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B} + \delta_{D} \mp \phi_{3})
\label{eq:DecayRateADSFAVpi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
		\Gamma_{FAV}^{\pm}(B^{\pm}\rightarrow (D^{*}\rightarrow
[K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}]_D\gamma))\propto |A^{\gamma}_{Bf_{FAV}}|^2 \propto 1 +
r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2} - 2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B} + \delta_{D} \mp \phi_{3})
\label{eq:DecayRateADSFAVgamma}
  \end{equation}
\\
\noindent The SUP mode is known as the ADS mode. $r_{D}$ and $r_{B}$ are of
similar magnitudes so the ADS mode possesses particularly high sensitivity to
$\phi_3$ as the relative size of the interference term is large. In the usual
ADS analysis~\cite{ADSRef}, two independent equations are obtained with three
unknowns, $r_B$, $\delta_B$ and $\phi_3$ ($r_{D}$ and $\delta_D$ are known from
measurements of $D$ decays). Performing the same method using
$B^{\pm}\rightarrow D^{*}K^{\pm}$ decays results in four independent equations,
Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateADSSUPpi0} and Eq.~\eqref{eq:DecayRateADSSUPgamma}. This
enhanced ADS method therefore has the potential to measure $\phi_3$ without
information from other modes.

\section{\normalsize $CP$ Observables}
We create observables that do not depend on absolute efficiencies by taking
ratios. The physics observables that will be measured in this analysis are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item The $CP$ asymmetries between $B^{-}$ and $B^{+}$ mesons decaying to $CP$
eigenstates, where $hh=\pi \pi /KK$:
		\begin{equation}
			A_{hh}^{\pi^{0}/\gamma}=\frac{\Gamma(B^{-}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})-\Gamma(B^{+}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{+})}{\Gamma(B^{-}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})+\Gamma(B^{+}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{+})} \label{eq:Aglw}
		\end{equation}
	\item The ratios of $D\rightarrow hh$, where $hh=\pi \pi /KK$, to the favoured mode,
scaled by the branching fraction:
		\begin{equation}
			R_{hh}^{\pi^{0}/\gamma}=\frac{\Gamma(B^{-}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})+\Gamma(B^{+}\rightarrow
			[[h^{+}h^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{+})}{\Gamma(B^{-}\rightarrow
			[[K^{-}\pi^{+}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{-})+\Gamma(B^{+}\rightarrow
			[[K^{+}\pi^{-}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{+})} \times
			\frac{\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\rightarrow
			K^{-}\pi^{+})}{\mathcal{B}(D^{0}\rightarrow h^{-}h^{+})} \label{eq:Rglw}
		\end{equation}
	\item The ratios of the ADS to the favoured mode, for $B^{\pm}$ decays. We
measure $R_{\pm}$ as opposed to $A_{ADS}$ and $R_{ADS}$ because the latter are
statistically correlated. It should be noted that this constitutes 4 independent equations.
		\begin{equation}
			R_{\pm}^{\pi^{0}/\gamma}=\frac{\Gamma(B^{\pm}\rightarrow
			[[K^{\mp}\pi^{\pm}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{\pm})}{\Gamma(B^{\pm}\rightarrow
			[[K^{\pm}\pi^{\mp}]_{D}\pi^{0}/\gamma]_{D^{*}}K^{\pm})} \label{eq:Rads}
		\end{equation}
\end{enumerate}
\noindent Direct $CP$ violation in $D$ decays is considered negligible, therefore
$A_{KK}^{\pi^{0}}=A_{\pi\pi}^{\pi^{0}}=A_{CP+}$,
$A_{KK}^{\gamma}=A_{\pi\pi}^{\gamma}=A_{CP-}$,
$R_{KK}^{\pi^{0}}=R_{\pi\pi}^{\pi^{0}}=R_{CP+}$ and
$R_{KK}^{\gamma}=R_{\pi\pi}^{\gamma}=R_{CP-}$.

We can express these ratios in terms of the parameters of interest:
  \begin{equation}
    A_{CP\pm}=\frac{\pm 2r_{B}\sin(\delta_{B})\sin(\phi_{3})}{1+r_{B}^{2}\pm 2r_{B}\cos(\delta_{B})\cos(\phi_{3})}
    \label{eq:ACP}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    R_{CP\pm}=\frac{1 + r_{B}^{2} \pm 2r_{B}\cos(\delta_{B})\cos(\phi_{3})}{1+r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2} \pm 2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D})\cos(\phi_{3})}
    \label{eq:RCP}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{K\pi}^{\pi^{0}}=\frac{2r_{B}\sin(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D})\sin(\phi_{3})}{1+r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2}+2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D})\cos(\phi_{3})}
    \label{eq:AfavPi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    R_{\pm}^{\pi^{0}}=\frac{r_{B}^{2} + r_{D}^{2} +
    2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B}-\delta_{D}\mp
    \phi_{3})}{1+r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2}+2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D}\mp
    \phi_{3})} \label{eq:RPlusMinusPi0}
  \end{equation}
  \begin{equation}
    A_{K\pi}^{\gamma}=\frac{2r_{B}\sin(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D})\sin(\phi_{3})}{1+r_{B}^{2}r_{D}^{2}-2r_{B}r_{D}\cos(\delta_{B}+\delta_{D})\cos(\phi_{3})}
    \label{eq:AfavGamma}

GLW analyses of $B^{\pm}\rightarrow D^{*}K^{\pm}$ decays have been successfully
studied by the Belle~\cite{BelleGLW}, BaBar~\cite{BaBarGLW} and
LHCb~\cite{PartReco} collaborations. The latter was performed recently using a
partially reconstructed analysis, where the neutral particle was not included in the
final state. In 2014, the BaBar experiment attempted the ADS analysis, but in
the absence of significant signal set the upper limit $r_B<0.21$ ($90\%$ C.L.)
\cite{BaBarADS}. No results have yet been published on the ADS mode from the
LHCb collaboration. 

\section{The LHCb Detector and Neutral Particle Reconstruction} \label{detector}
The LHCb~\cite{LHCbDetector} detector is located at the Large Hadron Collider,
a 27km circular $pp$ collider located at CERN. LHCb has been designed to study
$b$ and $c$ quarks, which are predominantly produced in the forward/backward
direction from gluon interactions. For this reason, LHCb is a single-arm
forward spectrometer covering the pseudorapidity region $2 < \eta < 5$, where
$\eta = -\ln (\tan \theta / 2)$. Here, $\theta$ is the angle between the
particle's momentum vector and the beam axis. During Run1 (Run2), the LHC
operated with a collision frequency of 20 MHz (40 MHz). At the interaction
point of LHCb the transverse overlap of the 2 beams is reduced so that on
average 1.7 $pp$ interactions occur per bunch crossing. To reduce the rate of
data uptake, online event selection consists of a hardware and software
trigger. The hardware trigger uses information from the calorimeter and muon
systems, and reduces the rate of information that needs to be stored down to 1
MHz, allowing latency for the full detector to be read out for the software
trigger, which involves a full event reconstruction. Events that pass the
software trigger are read out at a rate of 3 kHz (2011), 5 kHz (2012) and 12.5
kHz (Run2).

The full description of the LHCb detector can be found in \cite{LHCbDetector},
whilst the relevant components will be described here.  The vertex locator, a
semiconductor silicon detector with a transverse resolution of $\mathcal{O}(10$
$\mu$m), sits $8$ mm from the beam line in order to identify the $B$ and $D$
decay vertices crucial for this analysis. The rest of the tracking system is
located further from the $pp$ interaction point and consists of the Tracker
Turicensis (TT), positioned upstream of the dipole magnet, and tracking stations
T1-T3, downstream of the magnet. The TT and the inner tracker (IT) of T1-T3 are
also silicon microstrip detectors, whilst the outer tracker (OT) of the tracking
stations consists of straw drift tube detectors. The dipole magnet itself has an
integrated magnetic field $\int B dl = 4$ Tm.  Positive and negatively charged
particles bend in opposite directions in this field, therefore, to avoid charge
detection asymmetries, it's direction is reversed regularly during data taking.
There are also two Ring Imaging Cherenkov detectors (RICH1 and RICH2), placed at
different distances from the PV to provide particle identification (PID) of
kaons, pions and protons.

The reconstruction of neutrals involves the calorimeter system, consisting of
the electromagnetic (ECAL) and hadronic (HCAL) calorimeters preceded by the
Silicon Pad Detector (SPD) and Preshower (PS), separated by a lead wall. The
ECAL consists of alternating scintillating tiles and lead plates, and the HCAL
iron plates interspaced with scintillating tiles aligned parallel to the beam
pipe. The SPD identifies whether incident particles are charged or neutral,
whilst the PS determines whether they are electrons (if charged) or photons (if
neutral). Both the SPD and PS consist of scintillating pads and all light
produced in the system is sent down wavelength-shifting fibres and transmitted
to photomultiplier tubes.

Once a candidate has been identified as a $\gamma$ or $\pi^0$ from its energy
deposition sequence in the calorimeter system, reconstruction is performed using
the ECAL \cite{NeutralReconstruction}. Energy deposits in ECAL cells are grouped
together into clusters by applying a $3\times3$ cell pattern around the local
energy deposition maxima. If clusters overlap, a convergent iterative procedure
is applied that redistributes the cell energy between the clusters according to
their total energies.  Defining: 
\begin{equation}
  \chi^2_{2D}=(\vec{r}_{tr}-\vec{r}_{cl})^T(C_{tr}+S_{cl})^{-1}(\vec{r}_{tr}-\vec{r}_{cl})
  \label{Chi2}
\end{equation}
$\vec{r}_{tr}$ and $\vec{r}_{cl}$ represent the local coordinates of tracks and
clusters, respectively, at the energy-weighted cluster centres. $C_{tr}$ is the
covariance matrix of the $\vec{r}_{tr}$ and $S_{cl}$ is the cluster energy
spread matrix. Photon candidates are identified to be those without any
associated extrapolated track. This means that they must have a $\chi^2_{2D}$ of
at least 4 for every track in the event. 

The photon energy is then the sum of the total cluster energy in the ECAL and
the reconstructed energy deposit in the PS. Its direction is determined using
the assumed origin and cluster centre of the candidate. It should be noted that,
in this report, only unconverted photons have been considered, i.e. those that
have not pair produced upon reaching the SPD.

Neutral pions are then reconstructed as pairs of well separated photons. These
resolved $\pi^0$s have transverse momentum ($p_T$) in the range $p_{T}<2$ GeV/c.
Above this, the daughter photons cannot be identified as individual clusters due
to finite ECAL granularity. These merged $\pi^0$ candidates are not considered
in this analysis.

A charged particle passing through the whole tracking system has a 96\%
probability of being reconstructed, with a momentum resolution
$\mathcal{O}(0.5\%)$. In contrast, photons detected by the ECAL have a
reconstruction efficiency of ? \% and an energy resolution of ? \%. This is what
makes this analysis so challenging.

The data presented in this report was taken at center-of-mass energies of $7$
TeV in 2011, $8$ TeV in 2012 (Run1) and $13$ TeV in 2015, 2016 and 2017 (Run2),
resulting in a total integrated luminosity of $6.6$ $\text{fb}^{-1}$.
